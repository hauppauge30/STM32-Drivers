STM32 Drivers Project

The STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill development board contains a 32-bit Cortex-M3 RISC ARM core with an internal oscillator of 4-16MHz, which is a CMOS flash memory technology chip. The chip has 37 GPIO pins and 10 analog pins.

The STM32F103C8T6 has some modern communication interfaces such as CAN and USB ports. Since it runs at very low voltage, peripherals can have excellent control of the board, making it suitable for low power applications. It also comes with an integrated watchdog and a windowed watchdog timer for proper instruction execution.
